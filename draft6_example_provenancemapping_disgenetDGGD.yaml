## provenance mappingFile linked to draft6_example_registry_disgenetDG.yaml
## note that the only required fields for oneProvenanceUnit are name and sourceType

## TO-DO for CX:
## build a schema for this file (provenanceMapping -> string keys -> oneProvenanceList)
##   sub-schema to take from draft6_schema_registry_associationRetrieval.yaml
## oneProvenanceList, oneProvenanceUnit, referenceObject, contextObj 

## notes for CX:
##   currently single line descriptiveInfo to make editing easy 
##   ONLY INCLUDE VERSION WHEN THIS CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED, otherwise make a comment
##   try to include info (method, sourceContext, sourceReferences, descriptiveInfo) that will likely remain static
