## notes for developers:
## - use this to validate mappingFile linked by a registry entry
## - this schema has "$ref" that need to be expanded in use.
##   Python has the library jsonref that can be used for this. 
## - objects must include "type:object" and "properties". If removed, the
##   validation will not work correctly. 
## - from Andrew Su: for now, require less 

## will update with sub-schema for other mappings as needed

title: Schema for mappingFiles linked to x-bte-association-retrieval
$schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#'
type: object
description: >-
  Contains the mapping between possible values in the response fields (as
  string keys) to info in the desired format. Will be used often for provenance
properties:
  ## not required (not always mapping provenance)
  provenanceMapping: 
    type: object
    minProperties: 1
    patternProperties:
    ## keys are the possible value in API response field    
    ## If the API response sometimes doesn't include the field but you want to
    ##   recognize this situation and map it to info, use the key "default" 
    ## ?? are multiple fields ever used? Then mapping keys have to be combos of
    ##    string values (a string, concatenated with ";")
      .:   
        description: >-
          Array of objects (Python list-of-dict-like). Lists the sources and
          associated info (including how they create associations)

  contextObj:     
    description: >-
      Object, Python dict-like. Keys specify the type of context. Values
      depend on where the information comes from. After post-processing, the
      context should be ontology terms (curies) or short-strings.
      Context/relevance is information that restricts the use or
      interpretation of this association. This lets a developer know if the
      operation or the associations retrieved are relevant to the question
      being asked
