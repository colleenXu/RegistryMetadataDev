## example of what one disease -> chemical_substance association could look
##   like, after BTE processing a query's API/JSON-response using the
##   registry metadata 
## - the specific disease -> chemical_substance association modeled: the SECOND
##   JSON record in the API/JSON-response here:
##   https://automat.renci.org/cord19-scigraph/disease/chemical_substance/MONDO:0005016

## CX notes:
## - an ongoing issue: the metadata from the registry file likely doesn't need
##   to be on every single association. See schema for notes on what was kept
##   or left off from the registry metadata
## this is 79 char long #######################################################

  predicateInfo:  ## need the specific predicates for this edge 
  ## the registry file told BTE what JSON fields to use
  ## then BTE inserts data from that field into the metadata structure
    biolink: "related_to"
    id: "SEMMEDDB:ASSOCIATED_WITH"
  provenance:  ## need the specific provenance for this edge 
  ## It's a lot to have on every edge but saving records by uri and then 
  ##   looking them up later may be harder.  
  ## the registry file contains this static array. BTE inserts it here
