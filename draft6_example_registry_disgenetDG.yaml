## example of using the x-bte-association-retrieval schema 
##   to write a registry entry for querying MyDisease.info API 
##   with diseases -> genes 
## notes about this specific registry entry: 
##   none of the operations have restrictions (context/relevance)
##   some API/JSON-response fields weren't used (YearInitial, YearFinal for
##   the years first and last reported)
##   MyDisease.info is a complex API with a lot of operations/sources

## notes for developers:
##   this registry file is linked to other files: provenance-mapping files, 
##     BTE code files that post-process the API/JSON-response using the
##     registry and provenance-mapping files, and examples of what the
##     post-processed associations look like. 
##   in the future? have a script alerting developer of DisGeNET update.
##     Workflow is then to review the new DisGeNET data, change the pipeline
##     to update myDisease.info API if needed, AND update the metadata files
##     (the registry + linked files described above) as-needed.
