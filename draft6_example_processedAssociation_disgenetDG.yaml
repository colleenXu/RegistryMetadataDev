## example of what one disease->gene association could look like, after BTE
##   post-processing a query's API/JSON-response using the registry metadata 

## the specific disease -> gene association modeled: the FIRST JSON record
##   in the API/JSON-response here:
## http://mydisease.info/v1/disease/MONDO:0016419?fields=disgenet.genes_related_to_disease

## this corresponds with the source association webpage here: 
## https://www.disgenet.org/browser/0/1/1/C0006142/geneid__9-source__BEFREE/_b./

## CX notes:
## an ongoing issue: all the metadata for the operation in the registry file 
##   likely DOESN'T NEED TO HANG OFF every single association 
## go to the schema for notes on what to leave off and keep

  provenance:  ## need the specific prov. for this edge 
  ## the registry file told BTE what info to use and the mapping file, then
  ##   BTE maps the info in the JSON-response to the provenance array in 
  ##   the mapping file and inserts the array into the metadata structure
  ## maybe BTE can nest the association-retrieval provenance in a sub-field 
  ##   like this. Then the provenance edge property can also hold info for 
  ##   other operations that are done on this edge (like scoring)
