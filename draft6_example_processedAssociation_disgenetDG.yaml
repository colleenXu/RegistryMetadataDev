## example of what one disease -> gene association could look like, after BTE
##   processing a query's API/JSON-response using the registry metadata 
## - the specific disease -> gene association modeled: the FIRST JSON record
##   in the API/JSON-response here:
##   http://mydisease.info/v1/disease/MONDO:0016419?fields=disgenet.genes_related_to_disease
## - this corresponds with the source association webpage here: 
##   https://www.disgenet.org/browser/0/1/1/C0006142/geneid__9-source__BEFREE/_b./

## CX notes:
## - an ongoing issue: the metadata from the registry file likely doesn't need
##   to be on every single association. See schema for notes on what was kept
##   or left off from the registry metadata
