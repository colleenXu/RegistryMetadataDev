## instructions and response field to use is described in draft6_disgenetDG.yaml
## single lines for description right now since easier to edit this way
## TODO: not done yet. There's 17 of these...
## Thoughts: tweaked from original idea but still basically the same. Going through the description has been helpful 
##           for understanding method/knowledge source type/website_for_info, but is tedious. And not clear how much
##           work it would be to maintain this. DisGeNET updates ~ twice a year?

      The HPO consortium process for generating gene-phenotype annotations appears to be a mix of (1) manual curation using clinical experience or publications (done by clinicians, curators, and scientists registered with the HPO consortium) and (2) ingestion and parsing of other knowledgebases (OMIM, ORPHANET) with gene, phenotype, and disease information.

The annotations marked as validated were made by the CGI team using manually curated resources: the Cancer Gene Census, the CGI Catalog of Validated Oncogenic Mutations, and the CGI Cancer Biomarkers database. See the publication https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0531-8 under A comprehensive catalog of cancer genes across tumor types or under the supplementary info (Additional file 2, II) for more information on how the associations were made.

      ClinVar is an archive of reports of human genomic variation and phenotypes (their interpreted clinical significance). These reports come from other knowledgebases, researchers, professional groups, genetic testing labs, communiy projects, etc. However, ClinVar does not validate these interpretations, determine the correct interpretation of a variant, or review the criteria the submitter used in their interpretation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/validation/#interpretation).

      The DisGeNET team used specific criteria to keep a subset of the variant-disease associations from knowledge sources (see website for more details). To make gene-disease associations, they first reviewed this subset of variant-disease associations and only used those with variants that mapped to gene-coding sequences and had specific consequence types (using VEP). They then used gene-variant assignments from dbSNP to link genes to variants to diseases.
