response_field: disgenet.genes_related_to_disease.source
## field not used here: processing_response_field. used to explain what to do if this field has to be parsed (aka biolink api's source field with a string list..."
## biolink api will likely have a weird provenance: a biolink api provenance like what is shown here for an entry
## then another entry that says "multiple_sources", then gives the values and the link to learn more?
