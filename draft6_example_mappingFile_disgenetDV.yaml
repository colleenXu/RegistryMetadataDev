##   (variant-disease1 operation)
## notes for developers:
## - this has "$ref" that need to be expanded in use. 
##   Python has the library jsonrefs that can be used for this. 
## - from Andrew Su: for now, require less

## CX notes:
## - the only required fields for oneProvenanceUnit are name and sourceType
## - only include other fields (method, sourceContext, sourceReferences, 
##   descriptiveInfo) if the info will likely remain static 
## - version only included if it would be possible to automatically update,
##   otherwise I just left a comment

      The humsavar file from UniProt lists all missense variants annotated
      in human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries, along with their gene/protein
      and whether they are implicated in a specific disease.
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations are made by curators (1) using
      scientific literature or (2) reviewing and accepting the annotations
      made by computational analysis /automatic processing.

      publications and extract the variants with p-values below a threshold
      and the traits, phenotypes, and diseases studied.
