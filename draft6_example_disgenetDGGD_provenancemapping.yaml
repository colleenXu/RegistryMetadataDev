## instructions and response field to use is described in draft6_disgenetDG.yaml
## single lines for descriptiveInfo right now since easier to edit this way
## WIP: not done yet. There's 17 of these...

## Thoughts: tweaked from original idea but still basically the same. Going through the descriptiveInfo has been helpful 
##           for setting sourceType, method, descriptiveInfo but is tedious. And not clear how much work it would be 
##           to maintain this. DisGeNET updates ~ once a year?

      The DisGeNET team downloaded the genes_to_phenotype file from the HPO website. The DisGeNET team linked the gene-phenotype associations from this file and phenotype-disease associations to create gene-disease associations. (For each gene-phenotype association, the HPO file includes the disease annotated to both the gene and the phenotype. The DisGeNET likely used this annotation.)

    descriptiveInfo: >- 
      It looks like the HPO consortium generates gene-phenotype associations using their knowledgebase of disease-phenotype annotations and disease-gene annotations (mutation in a gene causes a disease). Gene-phenotype associations were made when a gene and phenotype were linked to the same disease. Disease-phenotype annotations and disease-gene annotations appear to be from (1) manual curation using clinical experience or publications (done by clinicians, curators, and scientists registered with the HPO consortium) or (2) ingestion and parsing of other knowledgebases (OMIM, ORPHANET, DECIPHER).

      ClinVar is an archive of reports of human genomic variation and phenotypes (their interpreted clinical significance). These reports come from other knowledgebases, researchers, professional groups, genetic testing labs, communiy projects, etc. However, ClinVar does not validate these interpretations, determine the correct interpretation of a variant, or review the criteria the submitter used in their interpretation.

    descriptiveInfo: >- 
      GWASdb was made by The Bioinformatics Group at The University of Hong Kong. They manually curated trait/disease-associated SNPs with genome-wide significance (p-value < 5 x 10-8). They also curated trait/disease-associated SNPs that were marginally significant (P-value < 10-3). They used original GWAS study publications (including the supplementary materials), the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, PheGenI, and HuGE as sources.

    descriptiveInfo: >- 
      The DisGeNET team used specific criteria to keep a subset of the variant-disease associations from knowledge sources (see website for specifics). To make gene-disease associations, they first reviewed that subset of variant-disease associations and only used associations with variants that mapped to gene-coding sequences and had specific consequence types (using VEP). They then used gene-variant assignments from dbSNP to link genes to variants to diseases.
