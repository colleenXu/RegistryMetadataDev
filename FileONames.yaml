## version types 
date_last_updated 
version_number
data_from_this_date  ## generic because I don't really know what this is: not date_downloaded, version_date, etc...
latest_date_covered  ## dealing with a range of dates? really it's the latest date that keeps updating so give this. 

## methods
## if you don't know the exact method then leave this off
ingest
NLP
manual_curation  ## means people are trained to do this (aka curators) and/or submissions are REVIEWED by curators before entering KB
## shared_n means association made since both entities annotated to the same thing (n)
shared_phenotype
shared_disease
shared_variant
submission  ## these are made by people BUT these aren't necessarily made or reviewed by curators
orthology_mapping ## association was in other species, mapped to human
shared_gene

## types of knowledge sources
service
knowledgebase  ## called GeneRIFs this since it's a collection of annotations
publications
## so what would be a database rather than a KB? 

directionMeaning
smaller
larger

more_evidence
more_specific
less_conflicting_evid
more_probable  ## maybe more likely to be a "real" association. related to statistics / network-based methods (co-occurrance or network topology connectivity is more than expected based on random / assumptions)
