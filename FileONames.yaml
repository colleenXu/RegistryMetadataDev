## version types 
date_last_updated 
version_number
data_from_this_date  ## generic because I don't really know what this is: not date_downloaded, version_date, etc...
latest_date_covered  ## dealing with a range of dates? really it's the latest date that keeps updating so give this. 

## methods
## if there are multiple methods, pick what we think is best for the one (so manual_curation > NLP) or we need to think about using lists and then concatenating that. 
ingest
NLP
manual_curation  ## means people are trained to do this (aka curators) and/or submissions are REVIEWED by curators before entering KB
## shared_n means association made since both entities annotated to the same thing (n)
shared_phenotype
shared_disease
shared_variant
submission  ## these are made by people BUT these aren't necessarily made or reviewed by curators
orthology_mapping ## association was in other species, mapped to human

## types of knowledge sources
service
knowledgebase  ## called GeneRIFs this since it's a collection of annotations
publications
## so what would be a database rather than a KB?
