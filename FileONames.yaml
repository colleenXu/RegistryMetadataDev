## thoughts on required stuff:
query_info:
  supportBatch: true/false
(optional fields inputSeparator, parameters, requestBody, )
inputs:
- id: UMLS
  semantic: Disease
outputs:    ## may need to make clear that the response field isn't a CURIE?
- id: NCBIGene
  semantic: Gene     
  response_field: "$disgenet.gene_related_to_disease.gene_id"
biolink_predicate: related_to    ## same as TRAPI/biolink predicate slot
relation_id: "SIO:001403"        ## same as TRAPI/biolink relation slot
(optional fields relation_label, nodes_conflated, websites, publications_ fields, provenance, numeric_measures, category_measures, context_relevance)
I would like to make a publications_ and a websites field required but ehh I think KPs doesnt always have this

if you have websites field with situation 3 (map/parse):  
## will there be only one website template for an association ever? 
websites:
  instructions:
  template:
  template_keys:
  (optional field bte_postprocess_code)
if you have provenance field with situation 3 (map/parse):  
provenance:
  instructions:
  response_fields_used:
  mapping_file:
  (optional field bte_postprocess_code)
if you have numeric_measures field (this is an array):
- name: "DisGeNET gene-disease association score"
  value: "$disgenet.genes_related_to_disease.score"
  range:
    minExclusive: 0
    maxInclusive: 1
  numeric_direction_info:
    larger: more_evidence
  (optional field website_for_info)
  
provenance/mapping:
  name: "MyDisease.info API"
  knowledge_source_type: service
  description: >- 
      Downloaded https://www.disgenet.org/static/disgenet_ap1/files/downloads/all_gene_disease_pmid_associations.tsv.gz. 
      Merged the gene-disease associations where the pmid column values differed but all column values were the same; 
      made the pmid column an array of the pmids.   
  (optional field website_for_info, knowledge_source_context)

## version types 
date_last_updated 
version_number
data_from_this_date  ## generic because I don't really know what this is: not date_downloaded, version_date, etc...

## methods
ingest
NLP
manual_curation  ## means people are trained to do this (aka curators) and/or submissions are REVIEWED by curators before entering KB
propagate_from_phenotype
propagate_from_protein_variant
propagate_from_seq_variant
submission  ## these are made by people BUT these aren't necessarily made or reviewed by curators
