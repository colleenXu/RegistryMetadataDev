## version types 
date_last_updated 
version_number
data_from_this_date  ## generic because I don't really know what this is: not date_downloaded, version_date, etc...
latest_date_covered  ## dealing with a range of dates? really it's the latest date that keeps updating so give this. 

## methods
ingest
NLP
manual_curation  ## means people are trained to do this (aka curators) and/or submissions are REVIEWED by curators before entering KB
propagate_from_phenotype
propagate_from_protein_variant
propagate_from_seq_variant
submission  ## these are made by people BUT these aren't necessarily made or reviewed by curators

## types of knowledge sources
service
knowledgebase
publications
## so what would be a database rather than a KB?
